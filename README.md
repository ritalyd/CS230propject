# CS230 Project: Image-tampering Classification for Fake News Detection

## Introduction
Growing research body has shown that image-tampering has become a salient strategy for fake news. To address this problem, we researched on ResNet-50 and VGG-16 models, implemented with the pretrained weights for ImageNet, and retrained on the CASIA dataset.

This repository stored the codes, plots and results of this project.
